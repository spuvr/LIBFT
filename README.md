# LIBFT - My Journey in C Programming at 1337 School

**Hello there!**

I hope this finds you well. My name is Oussama, and I’m a new student at 1337. Through this repository, I want to share my journey and experience working on the **Libft** project as a beginner exploring C programming for the first time.

## What I Hope to Achieve

By sharing every step of my journey, I hope this documentation will help others, especially beginners like me, to:
- Gain insights into approaching the Libft project.
- Learn from my challenges and solutions.

Feel free to explore the resources I’ve provided and learn from my experiences.

Happy coding!

## My Experience as a Beginner

When I started, I had no prior experience with coding. Here’s how my journey unfolded:

1. **Starting with Familiar Functions:**  
   I remembered some functions from the piscine, so the first six functions were manageable for me. However, things got challenging as I progressed further.

2. **Facing Time Constraints:**  
   I was battling against time, constantly learning and troubleshooting. Every day brought new challenges, exercises, and questions that I had to solve or understand.

3. **Learning the Basics:**  
   When I read the project subject for the first time, I was clueless. This was my first exposure to concepts like:
   - Header files  
   - Static libraries  
   - Makefiles  

   Thankfully, I sought help from senior students.
   I asked politely and received valuable insights that gave me a clearer vision of what to do and how to begin.

4. **Exploring New Concepts:**  
   I started by learning about **header files** and their purpose. The first thing I created was my `libft.h` file.  
   Then, I learned about **include guards/header guards** and their importance in preventing multiple inclusions. You can explore this topic visually [here](http://spuvr.byethost6.com/HEADER-GUARDS/).

## Key Takeaways

- The **Makefile** was something I initially thought was unnecessary, but I later realized it’s a vital tool to understand and master.
- Writing my functions and organizing their prototypes in the header file was a systematic process that taught me the importance of structure in programming.

So I started focusing on coding my functions and testing them. I explored many possible approaches to fully understand how each function worked. I spent time learning about memory management, how the compiler works, and the compilation steps. I read extensively and took my time because I believe everything I learn now will help me in future projects.

I realized that one of the most crucial aspects of programming is understanding memory—how to manipulate it, how data is stored, and concepts like overflow and overlap. I researched buffer overflow, memory management, and stack behavior. I also learned about how we reserve data in the stack and what happens when we lose a reference to data stored there. Throughout this process, I kept asking more experienced friends for help. They’d review my functions and challenge me with hypothetical scenarios: "If we pass this value as a parameter, what should happen?" These challenges helped me verify if I truly understood my own code.
