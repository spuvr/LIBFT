**Hello there **
i hope this find you well , my name is oussama , a new student at 1337.
i want to describe,share and say how my experience with this project was for a biginner that explore c here in the school without any background of coding before.
first i remember some of functions from the pool so i have no issue about them , the first 6 functions was good , but since there i was fighting with time and trying to understand everything because every single time someone give me another question or another challange or exercice that i have to fix or learn.
and here i want to share with you every step i made and im hoping that someone will find this and he will get information from it.
